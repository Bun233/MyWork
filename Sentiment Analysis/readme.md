Overall, this project trains a binomial na√Øve bayes model with 78% test accuracy, and applies it to film tweets using Twitter API. While the keywords and topics extracted are not particularly interesting, there is fairly high consistency between the ratings on IMDb and the ratings calculated from tweets, indicating the reliability of IMDb. Despite an upward trend in contradictory sentiment when year increases, the phenomenon is consistent with the skewed data in years. Moreover, further investigation into the contradiction rate suggests that films in thriller and mystery genres might receive polarity in viewer sentiment, which is not very concrete due to the limited datapoints.

The results for neural networks are not promising and are thus not adopted. Detailed information can be found in the relevant folder.
