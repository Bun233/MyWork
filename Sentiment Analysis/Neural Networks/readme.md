Overall, this project develops models for sentiment analysis using Na√Øve Bayes (NB), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Results indicate overfitting for the NB model while the problem for neural networks may be due to imbalance datasets.

It should be noted that this is a multiclass task while the one in the previous folder is binomial.
