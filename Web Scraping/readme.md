Overall, web crawling, data analysis, and data visualisation skills are applied to scrape the required website, store information in suitable formats, analyse different topics, and present relevant results. Specifically, question 1 stores unique webpage link in a list which question 2 utilises for consistency check. Question 2 stores text-based information in a data frame with individual topic and author in separate columns, and is saved to a csv file. Question 3 utilises TF-IDF. Question 4 presents most popular co-authors by author and topic. Question 5 selects features by random forest feature importance, and plot correlation between the two variables, finding a negative relationship.
